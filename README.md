# Get Started ðŸš€
vscode ETCD extension allows you work faster with your etcd instance in Visual Studio Code directly.

There are following commands:  
- `Get ETCD` 
- `Update ETCD` 
- `Add ETCD Url` 
- `Add ETCD Pod` 

Before first launch you need to set up your etcd url and pod via special commands:
